### Contribution Guidelines

> IMPORTANT: Please read the following before contributing to this project

#### Branch naming conventions:

A git branch should start with a category.
Pick one of these: `feature`, `bugfix`, `test`, or `docs`.

- `feature` is for adding, refactoring or removing a feature
- `bugfix` is for fixing a bug
- `test` is for creating/modifying test code (Jest)
- `docs` is for creating/modifying documentation

After the category should be a short text to describe the main objective of the branch. For example, commits for creating a navbar component will be under branch `feature/navbar-component`.
Remember to include the "/" character after the category text and use kebab-case.
